Bulgaria is home to 117 islands, including 80 river, 30 sea, and 7 lake islands. Of these, the Danube River hosts the largest share, with 64 islands located along it. Among them, Persin island (Belene) and Vardim island stand out as vital parts of natural and protected areas. The islands in the river offer a true parallel world without a sign of technical progress. Among sand, water and wild vegetation there are bird cities inhabited by dozens of species of water-loving birds that share the island spaces with amphibians, reptiles, mammals and invertebrates.
Almost half of our islands have been designated as protected areas, territories, or reserves. Logging, hunting, the introduction of non-native animal and plant species, and any activities that change the natural landscape are prohibited.

There are also several islands, such as Doychinov Island near the village of Batin and Kitka and Milka near Belene are entirely closed to the public, except for those related to scientific research, educational purposes, and activities related to management and protection.

## Persin island (Belene island)

Persin Island, also known as Belene, is the largest Bulgarian island on the Danube, with an area of about 41 km². It is a part of the Persina Nature Park. The island is located northeast of the town of Belene and has an elliptical shape.
The island was formed from the merging of several smaller islands. The lower areas are abandoned river branches filled with clay sediments. Large parts of the island are flooded during high water levels of the river, and there are also permanent marshes in its northeastern part. The island features alluvial and alluvial-swamp soils. Some areas of the island are covered with hygrophilous vegetation, including willow, poplar, aspen, and other species.

## Vardim Island

Vardim is a Bulgarian Danube island in the municipality of Svishtov, with an area of 4.9 km². The island’s unique nature is home to a special tree species called the Vardim oak. This type of oak is named after the island because it grows only there. On the island, besides the Vardim oak, there are also oak and European white elm trees. The island is one of the five most important nesting sites in Bulgaria for the great cormorant, black-crowned night heron and Eurasian spoonbill. Recently, the white-tailed eagle has been spotted, and until 1985, the pygmy cormorant, squacco heron, and glossy ibis had been observed.

The Bulgarian Danube islands are not only natural treasures but also important factors for the ecological balance of the region. They provide refuge for rare species and are crucial for the migration routes of birds.
