## Introduction to the wetlands

Wetlands are ecosystems in where water is the main factor, that recounts the ecological environmental conditions and the dwellers – animals and plants. Along the Danube they are formed mainly from season tributaries.

### General information:

• **Vegetation:**
Typical of wetlands of Danube basin wetlands are hydrophilic and hygrophilous plants such as canes, cattails, as well as coastal forests commonly found in the area.

• **Fauna:**
It is home to a variety of floating seabirds (Black stork, Dalmatian pelican), amphibians, fish (Northern pike, Grass carp), and also a lot of insects (odonates and mosquitoes) .

• **Ecology of Wetland Ecosystems:**
Wetlands clean the water, reduce the risk of floods, support biodiversity, and provide places for nesting and reproduction of rare species.

## Wetlands -Past and Present

In the past, wetlands of the Danube basin covered vast territories. Today’s lakes and marshes were once part of a natural water network, connected to the old riverbed. The local population used them for fishing and gathering reeds and rushes.

Today, due to the construction of levees, sewage from tributaries and intensive agriculture, wetlands have significantly decreased – globally more than half have been lost. In Bulgaria, only a few reserves have been preserved, as the „Srebarna“ Nature Reserve and wetland complexes near the Danube’s delta.

A number of applied scientific programs and international initiatives, as Ramsar Convention и Natura 2000, aim to preserve and restore them through:

- afforestation of riverside stripes,
- construction an artificial marshes,
- controlled flooding of former agricultural lands.

## Conclusion

Only a comprehensive approach –integrating on scientific research, effective legislation, education and local initiatives – can restore and протецт these absolutely valuable ecosystems.
