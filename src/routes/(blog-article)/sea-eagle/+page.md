## Description

The white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) also known as the sea eagle is one of the largest raptors in Bulgaria. Adults are brown and with a yellow beak while the young are identified with darker colors and a black beak.

## Habitat

In Bulgaria it is moslty found along the coast of the Danube river, with the largest number occuring between the towns Silistra and Nikopol. Smaller populations are observed around Lom and Kozloduy, as well as along along the Black Sea coast and the Maritsa river.

## Diet and behaviour

White-tailed eagles are carnivorous. They feed mostly on fish and water fowl like geese, swans and cranes, and can lift prey weighing up to 8 kg .During winter, however, they may switch their diet to hedgehogs, rabbits, or dead mammals. Juveniles are nomadic, but between their fifth and tenth year, they settle down. They are monogamous birds and migrate from Northern Europe to the Danube in search of more favorable living conditions.

## Reproduction

The nesting pair maintains several nests within their territory and each year refurbishes one to live in. These nests are most often located in the crowns of trees or on rocky ledges. The female lays 1–2, rarely 3, eggs, which are incubated for 35–42 days, with the female incubating them 95% of the time but occasionally, the male takes over for short periods.

## Conservation Status

In Bulgaria, their population is very small. In the 1980s, only one pair was observed, but their numbers have gradually increased, with 6 pairs recorded in the 1990s. A significant number of eagles migrate to Bulgaria during winter, with over 40 individuals observed along the Danube in 2005. Unfortunately, in other countries, their population is declining. The main reasons include deforestation, electric power lines, draining of lakes, poisoned baits, poaching, and disturbance during the breeding season.
