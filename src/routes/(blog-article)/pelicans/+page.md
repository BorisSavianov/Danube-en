The Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) is one of the largest flying birds in the world. Its wingspan reaches approximately 3 meters, its weight is around 10 kilograms, and its body length is about 1.8 meters. A distinctive feature of the species is the curly plumage on its head, from which it gets its name. The species is classified as Near Threatened in the International Red List of Threatened Species. The Dalmatian pelican is considered an indicator of the ecological condition of the wetlands it inhabits.

The Danube River plays an extremely important role in the species' survival and reproduction in Bulgaria. One of the most significant habitats for this endangered bird in the country is Lake Srebarna, located near the Danube River. Other important sites include Peschina Swamp and Dead Marsh, located on Persin Island, and since 2023, it has also been observed near the town of Tutrakan. The Burgas lakes—Atanasovsko, Vaya, and Mandra—are among the most important sites for the species during wintering and migration. During that time, gatherings ranging from several hundred to over a thousand individuals can be observed. In 2005, the global population of mature Dalmatian pelicans was estimated to be between 6,700 and 9,300. By 2017, thanks to various conservation measures, the population had increased to between 11,400 and 13,400 mature individuals. Despite this progress, experts predict a potential 25% decline in numbers in the future. In contrast, other pelican species worldwide show a population growth trend of around 38%.

Various measures are being implemented to protect the Dalmatian pelican. Artificial wooden platforms are constructed in bodies of water to provide safe nesting, breeding, and chick-rearing areas. Many of the sites where pelicans nest have been designated as reserves or protected areas. Awareness campaigns are organized to inform local communities and tourists. To reduce the risk of collisions with overhead power lines, reflective plates are installed to make the wires more visible to birds. Additionally, patrols and monitoring are conducted around nesting colonies to limit human disturbance and ensure a peaceful breeding environment.
