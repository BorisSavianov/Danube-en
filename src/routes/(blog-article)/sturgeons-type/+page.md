Having survived the last 200 million years, today the giant prehistorical sturgeons are the most endangered type of species in the world. The last naturally reproducing populations in Europe are fighting for their survival in the downstream of the Danube. The destruction of their habitats, the blocking of their migration routes, as well as the illegal trade of caviar are some of the main threats to these fishes. Despite the strict prohibition on fishing, the relentless poaching and the high demand on the black market continue to jeopardize the future of sturgeons.

## Measures to protect the species:

- Ban on fishing

- Control over caviar trade

- Breeding and releasing sturgeons into the wild

- Protection of habitats

- Scientific monitoring and research

- Educational information campaigns

- Stricter law enforcement

## Interesting facts about sturgeons

1. Sturgeons spawn in the gravel banks of the Danube at temperatures of at least 9–15°C.

2. Over 200 million years, sturgeons have hardly changed, maintaining their “dinosaur-like” appearance.

3. Once migration begins, the sturgeon stops feeding until it spawns and returns to the sea.

4. Sturgeons are indicators of the ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems because they live long, reach sexual maturity late, and use various habitats.

5. They feed mainly on fish, but larger individuals also prey on water birds.
