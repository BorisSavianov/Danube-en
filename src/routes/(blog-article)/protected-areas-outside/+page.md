The Danube River flows through multiple countries in Central and Eastern Europe, forming a vital ecological corridor of international importance. Beyond Bulgaria, several protected areas located along the Danube in Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, and Slovakia play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity and natural landscapes.

## Serbia and Croatia:

**Serbia:**

Djerdap National Park in Serbia is located in the northeastern part of the country, right on the border with Romania. Stretching for about 100 kilometers along the right bank of the Danube River from the town of Golubac, Djerdap National Park covers a narrow, forested hilly-mountainous zone, ranging from 2 to 8 kilometers wide and varying in altitude from 50 to 800 meters. Species such as owls, falcons, and wildcats can be found here.

**Croatia:**

Kopacki Rit Nature Park in Croatia is one of the most important wetlands in Europe, located near the city of Osijek, at the confluence of the Drava and Danube rivers. It is home to hundreds of bird species and other animals and is part of the internationally recognized ecological zone "Mura-Drava-Danube." Otters, beavers, herons, and similar species can be found there.

## Hungary and Slovakia:

**Hungary:**

Danube-Ipoly Nature Park in Hungary is located on both banks of the Danube River, near the Slovak border. The Danube islands between Budapest and Esztergom are also included in the national park. The park combines beautiful river valleys, forests, and karst hills. Part of it runs along the Danube and offers protection to rare plants and animals. Rare flowers and herbs can be found here, as well as the red-backed shrike.

**Slovakia:**

The protected area "Dunajske luhy" is located along the Danube River in southwestern Slovakia. It includes flooded forests, lakes, and river branches, creating ideal conditions for bird nesting. The area is part of the European ecological network Natura 2000. It is popular among nature lovers and offers opportunities for ecotourism, birdwatching, and educational activities. Species such as the marsh owl, spoonbill, and white stork can be found there.
