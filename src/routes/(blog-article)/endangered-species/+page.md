The Danube River is home to many biological species. However, among its vast biocenosis several endangered species stand out, deserving special attention.
**The white water-lily ** (Nymphaea alba) is one of the most elegant aquatic plants in Bulgaria. Its snow-white blossoms, reaching up to 20 cm in diameter, float gracefully on the surfaces of lakes and marshes. Its leaves also drift on the water, often bearing a reddish tint on their undersides. The plant can be found in the Danubian Plain, along the Black Sea coast, and in other wetland regions, yet today it is a rarity—an endangered species listed in Bulgaria’s Red Data Book and protected by the Biodiversity Act. The main threats to its survival include wetland drainage, water pollution, and tourism-related activities. Interestingly, the water-lily is not only a symbol of purity but also serves an ecological role—offering shelter to fish and helping to maintain the aquatic microclimate. Though it still exists in nature reserves such as Srebarna and Ropotamo, preserving it will require continued efforts, such as restoring wetlands and implementing consistent monitoring.

**The summer snowflake** (Leucojum aestivum) is a plant of delicate appearance, yet with remarkable potential—both ornamental and medicinal. It blooms in spring, producing fragrant white flowers tipped with green, several of which cluster at the top of a long, slender stem. The plant grows in wet meadows and riparian forests, including along the Danube’s Valley and in the Thracian Lowlands. It is protected under the Biodiversity Act, and its collection is strictly regulated. The reason lies in its content of galantamine—an alkaloid used in modern medicine to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Curiously, despite its medicinal value, the plant is poisonous and is used only after careful processing in controlled conditions. The summer snowflake is a compelling example of how a humble woodland herb can prove to be a key to human health.

Among the endangered fish species in the Danube is the sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), listed in Bulgaria’s Red Data Book. It is found only in the Danube River. In the past, it was also caught in the lower courses of some of its tributaries. It inhabits large rivers with fast currents and gravelly beds. The sterlet is a bottom-dwelling, primarily riverine species. In extremely rare cases, it can be found in brackish waters, and always close to river mouths. It overwinters in groups in deep holes on the riverbed, and in the spring (April–June), it migrates upstream to spawn.

Another endangered animal species is the fish known as the streber. It inhabits river stretches with fast currents and gravelly beds. It feeds at night on benthic invertebrates. It can reach up to 17 cm in length and up to 170 g in weight. **The main threats** to the species are water pollution and changes in river flow caused by hydrotechnical activities. Competition from species from the Cyprinidae family, whose number has increased in recent years, also has a negative impact.

**The threatening factors** for all species inhabiting the Bulgarian stretches of the Danube River are directly or indirectly the result of human activity. These include: climate aridification, loss or degradation of habitat due to the drainage of water bodies, overfishing, aggressively expanding water tourism, and most notably, water pollution.
