The Danube is the second longest river in Europe and flows through more countries than any other river in the world - ten in total. It is often referred to as the backbone of the European biodiversity.

Its water is an important ecological factor and also a living environment. Its role as such is determined by physical and chemical properties. The temperature of the Danube’s water has been rising in recent decades due to global warming and human activity. This leads to a decrease in the dissolved oxygen in the water, which harms many aquatic organisms. The water’s transparency is low compared to other European rivers, which hinders the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and phytoplankton, which form the basis of the river's food chains. The Danube is a low-salinity and slightly alkaline river, which supports a wide variety of freshwater species.

The most important factor affecting the water quality of the Danube is human activity. Untreated wastewater is a major source of microbiological pollution. The excessive amounts of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, caused by the discharge of agricultural fertilizers, lead to eutrophication - a rapid growth of algae that depletes oxygen and threatens aquatic fauna. Other types of pollution include the discharge of chemical waste and hazardous substances directly into the river. All of this negatively affects the flora and fauna of the Danube, which in turn also harms people.

Aiming to improve water quality and reduce waste and harmful substances in the river, many organizations and environmental programs have emerged - the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR), the Lower Danube Green Corridor agreement, “Danube 2030” (Austria) and many more. A lot of water treatment plants continue to be built to serve populated places near the river.
