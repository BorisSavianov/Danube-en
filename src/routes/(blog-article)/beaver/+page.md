The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) is a semi-aquatic herbivorous animal—the largest rodent in Europe and second in the world after the South American capybara. It has a stout body (about 1 meter long, weighing up to 30 kg), dense brown fur, and a distinctive flat, scaly tail, which serves as a rudder while swimming.

Beavers are called “river engineers”—peaceful animals known for their ability to build dams (dikes) and riverside lodges from branches and mud. They are active at night and live in family territories. They feed on aquatic and riverside plants, young shoots, and tree bark. With their sharp teeth, they cut down trees, leaving a distinctive “sharply pointed” cut.

## Return to Bulgaria

The Eurasian beaver was once widespread in Bulgarian lands. Between 1750–1850, the species disappeared due to mass hunting and habitat destruction. In 2020, the first signs of return appeared—tracks and camera trap footage in the Rusenski Lom area. By 2022–2023, 100–150 family groups (400–600 individuals) had been recorded along the Bulgarian Danube.

## Ecological Significance

Beavers create new habitats—their dams retain water, create wetlands, and reduce erosion. They enrich biodiversity by providing conditions for many other animals and plants. Beavers can serve as a natural tool for restoring wetlands.

## Current Threats

Today, threats come from conflicts with forestry, climate change, shrinking habitats, and potential competition from the invasive Canadian beaver. The most important factors are human tolerance and management of potential damage.

## Protection Measures

In 2023, a process began to declare the beaver a strictly protected species in Bulgaria. Plans include its inclusion in the Red Data Book and the creation of an Action Plan. The long-term goal is sustainable coexistence between humans and this valuable “river engineer.”
