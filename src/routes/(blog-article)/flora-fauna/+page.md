The Danube River is one of the oldest rivers in the world. It originates in the Black Forest mountains and flows through ten countries, including Bulgaria where it supports an exceptionally rich and diverse ecosystem.

## Flora along the Danube River

Along its banks, one can observe an extraordinary variety of unique species. The riverbed is the largest wetland area in Europe. The world’s largest reed beds (Phragmites australis) are found there, covering an area of 1,700 km². Several species of water lilies (Nymphaea) can also be found. The sandy areas are covered with feather grass (Stipa). Along the river's course, there are forests hosting numerous plants and animals. In the Litya forest, sand dunes stretch up to 250 meters long and 10 meters wide, where some trees reach up to 10 meters in height. Some of the most interesting and rare species include the summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum), which grows in floodplain forests and wetlands along the river, and the water lily (Nymphaea alba), a rare and locally endangered species found in „Persina“ Nature Park. Another type of water lily is the yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea), which is mainly found in protected areas because it is endangered. All of these species, including river comfrey and Danube bedstraw (Galium danubiale), are included in Bulgaria’s Red Data Book.

## Fauna along the Danube River

The river is home to over 300 species of birds, including the Dalmatian pelican, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), the red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis), the pygmy cormorant, the ferruginous duck , various herons, spoonbills, and ibises, as well as more than 75 species of fish and dozens of mammals. A significant percentage of the world’s bird population lives in the territories along the river. More than 45 species of fish, many of which are endangered, swim in the Danube Delta. Of the six sturgeon species that once inhabited the Danube, only four are now found in Bulgaria – the beluga sturgeon , the starry sturgeon , the Russian sturgeon , and the sterlet . The remaining two species – the ship sturgeon and the Atlantic sturgeon are considered long extinct. The causes for this are illegal fishing and the construction of dams and dikes, which block their migration. New colonies of the endangered pygmy cormorant have been established in the Kalimok area, where the colony numbers more than 300 pairs. A total of 1,333 Dalmatian pelicans have been counted, and in 2020, 30 nesting pairs were registered on an artificial platform in „Persina“ Nature Park. The great white pelican( Pelecanus rufescens) is a rarer species, with only 42 individuals recorded. The shores and waters are home to mammals such as the European beaver, the European otter, the wildcat , the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus), the steppe polecat , and the endemic Dobruja hamster (Mesocricetus newtoni).
In 2010, a non-native fish species, the Chinese sleeper (Perccottus glenii), was recorded in the Danube for the first time in Bulgaria. Likely introduced through ballast water from ships or by migratory birds, this species is native to Asia and poses a potential threat to local aquatic biodiversity.
