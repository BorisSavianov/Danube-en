The unique Persina Nature Park, the only one of its kind in Bulgaria, is located within the territories of three municipalities—Nikopol, Belene, and Svishtov. It was established on December 4, 2000, and covers an area of 21,762.2 hectares. Its mission is to preserve the important Danube riverside zones and protect the natural state of the numerous islands, including the Nikopol and Belene island groups. The park is named after the largest Bulgarian Danube island—Persin Island—which lies within its borders. Due to their high ecological value, the Belene Islands have been recognized as the most extensive Ramsar site in Bulgaria.

Situated in the Danubian zoogeographical region, Persina Nature Park is home to over 1,100 animal species. These include hundreds of species of plankton, benthos, and invertebrates, with dozens of species of snails and mussels. Common fish species include the Danube gudgeon, barbel, and whitefin gudgeon, among others. Amphibians are represented by 11 species, such as water and green frogs, the Balkan spadefoot toad, and the fire-bellied toad. The endemic Danube crested newt is found exclusively in this area. Reptiles include the common water snake, Crimean wall lizard, and sand boa, as well as three species of turtles.

The park lies within the Danubian biogeographical subregion and hosts 475 species of higher plants, many of which are water-related. Diverse plant formations can be found in the marshes and channels. The natural forests are mainly composed of various willow and poplar species, with ash and elm also present. Climbing plants like wild grapevine and hops add a unique riparian forest (longoz) character. The shrub layer is rich in blackberry, hawthorn, cornelian cherry, and other species. Open areas are covered with grasses such as couch grass and bentgrass, and ruderal vegetation is also diverse.

Persina is a vital refuge for rare plant species listed in the Bern Convention and the Red Data Book of Bulgaria, including water wheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa), water chestnut (Trapa natans), four-leaf clover (Marsilea quadrifolia), and many other aquatic and marsh species.

Bird diversity is undoubtedly the greatest treasure of Persina Nature Park. More than 200 bird species have been recorded here, nearly all of which have some conservation status, emphasizing their vulnerability and the need for protection. The Belene Islands within the park are of exceptional importance, ranking among the five most significant habitats in the region for key species such as the great and pygmy cormorant, black-crowned night heron and squacco heron, little and great egret, purple heron, Eurasian spoonbill, the remarkable glossy ibis, ferruginous duck, and the elegant common and little tern.
