There are eleven regulated active Nature Parks in Bulgaria, three of which are located along or in close proximity to the Danube River – “Kalimok-Brushlen” protected area, “Rusenski Lom” Nature Park and “Srebarna” Nature Reserve.

The “Srebarna” Nature Reserve is reported by the WWF to be home to more than 1430 plant types, 200 species of mammals and 221 bird species. The Dalmation Pelican (Pelecanus crispus) colony is the most treasured element of the reserve. These colonies can be found on the Balkan Peninsula and the only one in Bulgaria can be found on the park’s floating island, but it is endangered by the rising river levels, as the nests do not always rise with the river level, , putting eggs and chicks at risk.

“Rusenski Lom” is one of the most remarkable places in the country. Located in the northeastern part of the country, close to the city of Ruse, the park is home to impressive rock formations, rich biodiversity and numerous historical monuments. Within the park's boundaries, 32 types of current ecosystems have been identified, including 19 deciduous forest types, 3 shrub types, 4 grass-shrub types, and 6 grass ecosystems. One of the most valuable biological features is the root coenoses of the oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), as they are located very close to the northern edge of its natural range.

“Kalimok-Brushlen” protected area was created in order to protect one of the few remaining Danube wetlands and its unique biodiversity. The area is a key habitat for over 200 bird species, including the globally endangered pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmaeus) and dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus). The flora in the area is also diverse as there are rare aquatic and riparian species listed in the nation’s Red Data Book. There is also one of the largest Heron (Ardeidae) colonies in Bulgaria and one of the last few remaining century-old elms, black poplars (populus nigra) and Vardim Oak in Bulgaria.
