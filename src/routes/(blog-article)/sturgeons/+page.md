# 1 Biological characteristics

### 1.1 Taxonomy and species diversity

The Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso) and other sturgeons are a species of fish in the sturgeon family Acipenseridae which belongs to the order Acipenseriformes.

Several species of sturgeon are found in the Danube River, the largest and most well-known among them being the Danube beluga sturgeon, which migrates from the Black Sea to spawn. Other species of sturgeon found in the Danube river include: Russian sturgeon, ship sturgeon, sterlet and others.

### 1.2 Morphology and size

Beluga sturgeon have an elongated, spindle-shaped body, covered in five rows of bony scutes instead of scales. Their snouts are wide and flat, equipped with four sensory barbels and their mouth is located on the underside. The upper part of their tail fin is longer than the lower one.

Their colouring on their back is gray-black and silvery-white on their belly.

They typically reach a length of 2.5 to 4 meters and a weight of 200 to 400 kilograms, but can grow up to 7 meters long and weigh as much as 1,500 kilograms.

### 1.3 Lifecycle, feeding and breeding

Sturgeon are anadromous species: they spend most of their lives in the salty waters of the Black Sea but migrate into the Danube River to reproduce. They feed on mollusks, small fish, crustaceans and worms.

Spawning occurs in the spring (April-June) in the upper reaches of the Danube and its tributaries. During breeding they migrate hundreds of kilometers upstream, most often reaching the area of the "Iron Gates" on the border between Serbia and Romania(today affected by dams). The females can lay up to 1 million eggs.

### 1.4. Habitat and migration routes

The Caspian and Black Seas, together with the rivers flowing into them, are the only habitats of the beluga sturgeon. The main habitat of adult sturgeons is the Black Sea, where they spend most of their lives. Despite the salt water of the Black Sea, the Beluga sturgeons return to freshwater rivers such as the Danube to breed. Some beluga sturgeons also migrate to the tributaries of the river.

# 2 Reasons for population decline

### 2.1. Poaching

Overfishing of beluga sturgeons is one of the main factors contributing to the decline of their population. Although sturgeons, including the beluga sturgeon (Huso huso), are protected by international and national laws, illegal fishing and excessive harvesting of their caviar remain serious issues. One of the main reasons for their overfishing is the high demand for their caviar.

Fishing with illegal nets and electric devices destroys adult individuals before they reach their spawning grounds.

### 2.2. Loss of habitat and food sources

Loss of natural habitat is one of the main causes of the decline in beluga sturgeon populations. This is due to human activities such as the construction of dams along the river, which obstruct the free migration of sturgeons. These barriers block access to their traditional spawning grounds.

Pollution of the Danube from industrial waste and agricultural waste degrades water quality. This harms not only sturgeons but all other river organisms, leading to the destruction of their main food sources.

### 2.3. Limiting the breeding grounds in rivers

The construction of dams and hydropower plants along the Danube River and its tributaries poses a major obstacle to the reproduction of beluga sturgeons. These structures block the natural migration routes of the fish, preventing them from reaching their spawning grounds.

One particularly significant barrier is the “Iron Gates” dam complex on the border between Serbia and Romania. After its construction, access to many of the sturgeons’ traditional spawning areas in the upper Danube was completely cut off.

The lack of fish passages has led to the near disappearance of beluga sturgeon populations.

# 3. Conclusion

Beluga sturgeons are a key indicator of the ecological state of the Danube, but their populations are critically endangered due to human activity. Their preservation requires strict control of poaching, restoration of habitats, and the construction of migration corridors.
